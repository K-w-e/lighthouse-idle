# Lighthouse Idle

An idle/incremental game created for the GitHub Game Off 2025. The theme of the jam was "WAVE".

## Gameplay

In Lighthouse Idle, you are the keeper of a lone lighthouse. Your mission is to keep the light shining to guide ships safely through the treacherous waters.

- **Generate Light:** Click on the lighthouse to generate light. Each flicker of light earns you money.
- **Waves:** Be warned! Destructive waves will periodically crash against your lighthouse, causing damage.
- **Upgrades:** Use your earnings to purchase upgrades. Increase your income, automate light generation, and improve your lighthouse's defenses.
- **Repair:** Keep your lighthouse in working order by repairing the damage caused by the waves. If the lighthouse's health drops to zero, the game is over.

## How to Play

1.  Click the lighthouse to generate light and earn money.
2.  Go to the shop to buy upgrades that increase your earnings and automate processes.
3.  Repair the lighthouse after it's been hit by waves to keep it from being destroyed.
4.  See how long you can last and how much money you can make!
